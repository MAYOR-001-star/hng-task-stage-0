# 🧑‍💻 HNG Internship - Frontend Wizards Stage 0 Task

This project is my submission for **HNG Frontend Track Stage 0** — a simple, accessible, and responsive **Profile Card** built using **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
All requirements have been implemented with correct `data-testid` attributes for automated testing.

- All links are keyboard-focusable and use `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Avatar includes descriptive `alt` text.
- Layout adapts cleanly from mobile to desktop using **Flexbox**.
